  <h2>Things to do in Izmir</h2>

  <h3>Visit the Kemeraltı Bazaar</h3>
  <p>The Kemeraltı Bazaar (<a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=tr&text=Kemeralti%20Bazaar">Kemeraltı Çarşısı</a> in Turkish) is a popular place for residents to do a variety of shopping, from groceries to clothes to sitting down for Turkish classics like fried fish or kebab. </p>

  <h3>Buy simit from a street vendor</h3>
  <p>Simit is a classic twisted sesame seed-coated bread. Simit vendors are everywhere in the main parts of the city, and it's totally worth trying a very common Turkish food. Izmir has its own special variety of simit that is made with molasses called "gevrek," and when you are buying simit in Izmir, you are actually probably buying gevrek.</p>

  <h3>Bike or walk along the <em>kordon</em></h3>
  <p>The <em>kordon</em> is the part of the city that wraps around the water. So much of the city is wrapped around the water that there are ferries that run across the water. It is very common to also walk or bike along the <em>kordon</em> because the view is incredible, especially when the weather is nice. You'll come across restaurants, grass, monuments, and even parks.</p>
